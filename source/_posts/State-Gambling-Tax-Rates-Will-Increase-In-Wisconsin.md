#  State Gambling Tax Rates Will Increase In Wisconsin

This January, the Wisconsin state government announced that gambling tax rates will be increasing in order to generate more revenue for the state. The new tax rates, which will go into effect on February 1st, 2018, will apply to all forms of gambling, including casinos, racinos, and tribal gaming operations.

The increase in tax rates was proposed by Governor Scott Walker in his budget proposal for the 2018-2019 fiscal year. The proposed budget included a $250 million increase in gambling taxes, which is intended to help offset a $1.3 billion projected budget shortfall.

Under the new tax rates, the state’s share of casino revenues will increase from 20% to 25%. Racino revenues will be taxed at a rate of 33%, up from 25%. And tribal gaming profits will be taxed at a rate of 18%, up from 17%.

Wisconsin is not alone in its efforts to increase gambling taxes. Earlier this year, New York also proposed an increase in its gambling taxes as part of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s 2018-2019 budget proposal. Under the proposed budget, the taxation rate on casino slot machines would increase from 8% to 10%, and the taxation rate on other casino games would increase from 15% to 17%.

The rationale behind these proposed tax increases is that they will help states generate much-needed revenue during times of budgetary shortfall. However, it remains to be seen whether or not these tax hikes will actually have the desired effect.

#  How Much Tax Do You Have To Pay On Gambling Winnings In Wisconsin?

In Wisconsin, gambling winnings are taxable. The tax you have to pay on your gambling winnings depends on how much you won and your filing status.

If you file as a single taxpayer and you win more than $600, you will owe taxes of 25%. If you file as married filing jointly and you win more than $1,200, your tax bill will be 25%. If you file as head of household and you win more than $1,200, you will owe taxes of 25%. And if you are a qualifying widow or widower with dependent children and you win more than $1,200,again your tax bill will be 25%.

But there is good news. If your gambling winnings are less than $600 (or less than $1,200 if you are married filing jointly or head of household), then there is no Wisconsin tax due on those winnings.

So whether your gambling wins are big or small, make sure to report them on your Wisconsin tax return. And remember that gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income – so keep good records of your bets and wagers!

#  What Are The Wisconsin Gambling Taxes?

In Wisconsin, gambling taxes are imposed on the net income of casino operators and racetrack operators. The tax rate for casino operators is 25%, while the tax rate for racetrack operators is 10%.

In addition, a wagering tax is imposed on the winning bets of players at a rate of 5%. This wagering tax is collected by the state lottery, which then distributes it to the casino and racetrack operators.

The taxes collected from gambling activities in Wisconsin are used to support various programs and services in the state.

#  Get Ready To Start Paying More For Gambling In Wisconsin

Starting in 2019, Wisconsinites will start paying more for gambling. That’s because the state has increased its taxes on casino and lottery gambling. In fact, the new taxes are among the highest in the country.

The increase comes as a result of a bill signed by Governor Scott Walker in September. The bill hikes taxes on casino table games, machines, and tickets from 17% to 21%. It also increases the tax on lottery tickets from 5% to 6.5%.

Wisconsin isn’t the only state to make changes to its gambling taxes recently. In August, Michigan increased its tax on casinos from 19% to 21%. And in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo is proposing a $1 increase on casino taxes, from 14% to 15%.

Several other states have also proposed or passed gambling tax hikes this year. Idaho is considering raising its tax on casinos from 11% to 12%. Indiana is proposing an increase in its tax on horse racing from 2% to 4%. And Pennsylvania is considering a hike in its slot machine tax from 54% to 55%.

There are several reasons for these increases. For one thing, gambling revenue is down nationwide. According to estimates by the American Gaming Association (AGA), revenue from commercial casinos was down 3.6% nationwide in 2017 compared with 2016. One reason for the decline is competition from new states that have legalized gambling in recent years, such as Ohio and Illinois.

Another reason for the uptick in gambling taxes is pressure from state governments to find new sources of revenue. With budgets tight, many state governments are looking for ways to bring in more money without raising taxes on individuals or businesses. Gambling seems like an appealing option, since it’s largely considered a sin tax (i.e., people are willing to pay more for it).

Whatever the reasons for the increases, they’re likely to lead to higher prices for gamblers in Wisconsin and other states. So if you enjoy playing slots or blackjack at your local casino or betting on horses or lottery tickets, be prepared to pay more starting next year!

#  Wisconsin Increases Gambling Tax

In what many are calling a surprise move, the state of Wisconsin has substantially increased its gambling tax. The new rate, which was passed into law on Wednesday, affects both online and land-based casinos, raising the tax from 25% to 34%.

The new legislation is expected to generate an additional $35 million for the state annually. Republican State Senator Alberta Darling, one of the bill's sponsors, said that the money will be used to "support critical state priorities like public education and property tax relief."

Governor Scott Walker also voiced his support for the measure. "This successful bipartisan legislation provides much-needed property tax relief and funds education initiatives," he said in a statement.

Not everyone is happy with the increase, however. Some casino operators argue that it will make them less competitive against neighboring states. "This dramatic hike in taxes will undoubtedly lead to reduced gaming revenues and fewer jobs in our state," said Mark Keckler, president of the Lakefront Hotel and Casino Association.

Despite these concerns, lawmakers pushed the bill through despite strong opposition from some corners of the gambling industry. The final vote was 31-1 in favor of the increase.
