#  How to Safely Quit Playing in a French Casino: Saying Stop in French

When you’re in a French casino and you want to quit playing, it’s important that you do so in the correct way. Otherwise, you might end up in trouble with casino staff or security. Here are some tips on how to say stop in French when you want to leave the casino table.

First and foremost, always be polite when quitting a game in a French casino. Casinos are often very busy places, and the staff members are usually working hard to keep things running smoothly. So, say “merci” or “thank you” when you leave the table, even if you’re frustrated or angry about losing money.

Once you’re ready to quit, start by saying “Je me retire/ Je m’en vais” which means “I am withdrawing/I am leaving.” This will let the other players at the table know that you’re finished and they can continue playing without you. If there are any chips left on the table, put them all in the middle and announce “Je couche mes jetons/mes cartes” which means “I am putting down my chips/cards.” This will let everyone at the table know that the hand is over and they can begin to collect their winnings or losses.

Lastly, don’t forget to thank the dealer before you leave!
