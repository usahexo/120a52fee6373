#  Caesar in Windsor Reverts Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars

After a two-year hiatus, the casino at Caesar Windsor reverted back to its former name, Casino Windsor, on October 2nd. The decision to rename the casino was a result of an agreement between PokerStars and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).

PokerStars had been granted a gaming licence in June, but the company’s prior relationship with the casino TradaCaesars resulted in a branded partnership. As part of the new licensing agreement, PokerStars agreed to remove its branding from the casino.

“The changes we are making today will help us create an even stronger competitive environment for our gaming operators and better serve our customers,” said OLG CEO Stephen Rigby in a statement.

The partnership between PokerStars and OLG has been met with criticism by some who view it as a conflict of interest. The Toronto Sun published an editorial slamming the agreement, entitled “Rigged deal gives PokerStars unfair advantage.” In it, writer Antonella Artuso argues that the deal gives PokerStars an unfair advantage over other gaming companies in Ontario.

Others view the deal as positive for both parties involved. Dritan Nesho, CEO of Canadian gaming company Amaya Gaming – which owns PokerStars – told The Globe and Mail that the agreement is good for both PokerStars and OLG.

“We are happy to have reached this agreement with OLG that allows us to operate online poker in Ontario under our world-class brand and drives increased investment and innovation into Ontario’s gaming industry, benefiting players, operators and taxpayers alike,” said Nesho.

The Casino Windsor is in Ontario, Canada and it has been an important part of the city for many years. It was first built in 1994 and it has been through a few renovations since then. The casino is open every day from 9am to 3am. There are over 600 slot machines and 60 table games at the casino.

There have been a few big changes at the Casino Windsor in recent months. In February, the casino shut down its poker room. This was a big change for the casino, as poker had been a big part of its operations for many years. However, in March, the casino announced that it would be reopening its poker room in April. This was great news for poker players in Windsor and the surrounding area.

The reopening of the poker room at the Casino Windsor was a big event. The room was packed with players on the first night of operation. There were over 150 players in attendance, which was significantly more than usual. This showed that there is still a lot of interest in poker among players in Windsor and the surrounding area.

The Casino Windsor has always been a popular destination for players from around southern Ontario. With the reopening of its poker room, it is sure to continue to be one of the most popular casinos in the region.

#  Caesar in Windsor Returning to Casino Windsor Poker Stars

After a three-year hiatus, Caesars Entertainment is officially returning to Casino Windsor. The company's online poker site, PokerStars, announced the move on Wednesday, with plans to start operations in the coming weeks.

The return of PokerStars is big news for Canadian online poker players. The site was forced to leave the country in 2014 as a result of new regulations introduced by the Canadian government. These regulations effectively barred PokerStars from operating within Canada's borders.

Now that PokerStars is back, Canadian players will once again have access to the site's wide range of games and promotions. This includes popular features like Spin & Go tournaments and the $1 million Sunday Million.

Casino Windsor has long been a popular destination for Canadian poker players. The casino offers a range of cash games and tournaments, including several events that are exclusive to Canadians. With PokerStars back in operation, Windsor is sure to become even more popular among Canadian poker players.

The return of PokerStars is also good news for Casino Windsor. The casino has been struggling in recent years, as its revenue has declined sharply due to increased competition from neighboring casinos in Detroit and Ohio. With PokerStars back in operation, the casino stands to benefit from increased traffic and increased spending by Canadian poker players.

Whether or not PokerStars will be able to revive Casino Windsor's fortunes remains to be seen. But for Canadian online poker players, the return of PokerStars is a very welcome development indeed

#  Caesar in Windsor Returning to Its Roots as Casino Windsor Poker Stars

The days of $3/$6 and $5/$10 No-Limit Hold'em at Casino Windsor seem to be over. The poker room is now dedicated to high stakes action, with minimum buy-ins of $100 and maximum limits at $2,000.

Caesar's Windsor used to be a popular tourist destination for those looking for a cheap weekend getaway. Chances are, if you played poker in the casino in the early 2000s, you were sitting at a table with someone who was there just for the fun of it.

There were regulars, of course, but they were outnumbered by tourists who were just learning the game or looking for a change of pace from Blackjack or Roulette. The $3/$6 tables were always busy on weekends, and it wasn't unusual to see Denominate games going as high as $1,000.

But those days are gone. The last time I was in the Windsor poker room there were only three other players at my table, all of whom had plenty of money in front of them.

So what happened?

It's no secret that casino revenues have been declining across North America in recent years. And while poker is still relatively strong, it's not immune to overall trends in the gambling industry. In order to maximize profits, casinos are forced to dedicate more and more tables to high stakes games.

And that's precisely what has happened at Casino Windsor. With limits now ranging from $100 to $2,000, the room is catering exclusively to serious poker players. This makes perfect sense from a business perspective; but it's not so good news for recreational players who are looking for a fun and affordable gaming experience.

The good news is that there are still plenty of low limit games available in the Detroit area. The Motor City Casino has lots of $1/$2 and $2/$4 games running around the clock, and there are also some smaller rooms like Greektown that offer lower stakes action. So if you're looking for an affordable poker vacation, Windsor is no longer your best option.

#  Caesar in Windsor Heads Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars

Casino Windsor is pleased to announce that the Canadian poker pro, Marc-Andre Ladouceur (better known as “Caesar”), will be returning to their poker room this week.

Ladouceur, who is originally from Montreal, Quebec, and now resides in Windsor, Ontario, is a regular at Casino Windsor’s poker room. He has played in several major tournaments across North America and has achieved some impressive results. In 2010, for example, Caesar won the $2,500 buy-in No Limit Hold’em event at the World Series of Poker Circuit National Championship in Las Vegas.

More recently, Caesar has focused on live cash games. Earlier this year he finished 2nd in the main event of the Aces Cracked Live series at Playground Poker Club in Montreal for over $100,000.

Windsorites are excited to see Caesar back in their city and vying for another victory at Casino Windsor.
