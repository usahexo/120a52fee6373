His ownership was passed on to his wife, Muriel, who sold the team to Bud Adams in 1973. Adams owned the team until his death in 2013. His ownership was then passed on to his son-in-law, Tommy Smith.

#  How did the Tennessee Titans come to be?

Formed in 1960 as the Houston Oilers, the team relocated to Tennessee in 1997 and took on their current name. The Titans have had a relatively successful history, making it to the Super Bowl once and winning the AFC championship in 1999. Here is a look at some of the key players and moments in the team's history.

The Oilers were founded by Bud Adams, a Texas oilman, who also owned the Houston Texans of the American Football League (AFL). The team played their first season in Houston in 1960, and made it to the AFL Championship game but lost to the Dallas Texans. In 1961, they again made it to the Championship game but lost to the San Diego Chargers.

In 1996, Adams announced that he was moving the team to Tennessee due to stadium problems in Houston. After a public vote, the team was renamed the Tennessee Titans and began playing in Nashville in 1997. The new stadium was built with private money by Adams, and is now known as LP Field.

The Titans had some early success in Tennessee, making it to the Super Bowl in only their second season there (after winning the AFC championship). However, they lost to Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams 23-16. The Titans have been relatively unsuccessful since then, making it past the divisional round only once (in 2008).

Some of the key players for the Titans have included Steve McNair, Eddie George, Marcus Mariota, and Derrick Henry. McNair was drafted by the Oilers in 1995 and played for them until his death in 2009. George was drafted by the Oilers in 1996 and played for them until 2004. Mariota was drafted by the Titans in 2015 and has been one of their best players ever since. Henry was drafted by the Titans in 2016 and has become one of their primary running backs.

#  What are some of the Titans' most notable players and accomplishments?

The Titans joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960 and have enjoyed a good deal of success, including reaching the Super Bowl twice. Some of the team's most notable players and accomplishments include:

#  How do the Tennessee Titans fare in comparison to other NFL teams?

The Tennessee Titans are a professional American football team based in Nashville, Tennessee. The Titans compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at Nissan Stadium in downtown Nashville, which is also the home of the Tennessee State Tigers football team.

The Titans began play as the Houston Oilers in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Oilers competed in the AFL until joining the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. After playing one season as the "Tennessee Oilers," the team changed its name to "Titans" in 1999.

The Titans have played in Houston, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee, before settling in Nashville. The franchise has won one championship, which came during their time in Houston. Additionally, six former Titans players have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The Titans are one of four current teams that have never reached the Super Bowl; however, they have played in 9 playoff games since leaving Houston and won 4 playoff games including 1 on the road. They also reached and lost Wild Card Game against Baltimore Ravens after winning their first-ever AFC South title. In comparison to other NFL teams, how do they fare? 

Below is a table that showcases each NFL team’s record over the past ten seasons (2008-2017). As shown, some teams had more successful seasons than others. For example, both the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons had 9 wins during 2017 while others such as Miami Dolphins only had 6 wins. 

Looking at this table, we can see that out of all 32 teams, the Titans rank 18th with a combined win/loss record of 68-82-0 or 44%. This statistic is not ideal and could be improved upon however it is not bad compared to some of the other teams’ records. For example, Cleveland Browns ranks last with a combined win/loss record of 17-63-0 or 21%.
