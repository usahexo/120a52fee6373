#  How to make a wooden slot device 

Making a wooden slot machine is a great way to add a touch of class to any room, and it can be a lot of fun to play with as well. Here are the steps you need to follow to make your own wooden slot machine:

1. The first step is to cut out the pieces for the body of the machine. You will need two pieces that are 9” by 5”, and two pieces that are 5” by 2”.

2. Next, you need to drill four holes in each of the larger pieces. The holes should be spaced evenly on the short side of each piece. The holes should be 3/4” in diameter.

3. Then, you need to use a jigsaw to cut out the shapes for the front and back of the machine. The front piece should be 9” by 3”, and the back piece should be 5” by 2”.

4. Next, you need to sand all of the edges and surfaces of the pieces until they are smooth.

5. Then, you need to stain or paint the pieces in your desired color scheme.

6. Once everything is dry, you can assemble the machine by attaching the two small pieces to either end of the two larger pieces using wood glue and screws. Be sure to put the screws in from the outside so that they are not visible once everything is assembled.

7. Finally, you can install the coin return button and screen on the front of the machine using adhesive velcro or screws.

Making a wood slot device is a great way to recycle unwanted wood, and it can be a fun and challenging project. The first step is to select the right piece of wood. You'll need a piece that is at least 24 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick. You can use a thicker piece of wood if you want, but it will be more difficult to cut.

The next step is to cut the wood into two 12-inch pieces. Use a saw to make the cuts, being careful not to damage the edges. If you're using a thicker piece of wood, you may need to make longer cuts.

Next, use a drill to create two 5/8-inch holes in one end of each piece of wood. These will be used for the screws that hold the device together.

Now it's time to cut the slots in the wood. Use a saw to cut two 1-inch slots in the middle of each piece of wood. Make sure that the slots are parallel to each other and are centered on the wood.

Next, use a drill bit that is slightly smaller than your screws to create pilot holes in each end of the wood. These holes will help keep the screws from splitting the wood.

Finally, it's time to put everything together. Start by drilling pilot holes in each end of one of the 12-inch pieces of wood. Next, screw one end of the other 12-inch piece of wood into place using two screws.

Now slide the two pieces of wood together so that the slots are aligned. Drill pilot holes through both pieces of wood and then screw them together using four screws. Be careful not to overtighten the screws or they may crack the wood.

This article will show you how to build your own wooden slot device. Supplies you will need include a piece of wood at least 24 inches long and 3 inches wide, a jigsaw, a drill, an electric screwdriver, sandpaper, wood glue, clamps, and a 1 inch hole saw.

Instructions
1) Cut the piece of wood into four equal pieces using the jigsaw.
2) Drill two 1/8 inch holes in the center of each piece using the drill.
3) Using the electric screwdriver, attach one end of each of the four pieces together using 2-inch wood screws.
4) Sand all surfaces of the device with sandpaper.
5) Apply wood glue to each joint and clamp the device together until the glue dries. 
6) Drill a 1-inch hole in the center of the top of the device using the hole saw.

#  How to make a simple wooden slot device 

Wooden slot devices are a fun way to pass the time and can be made with a few simple tools. In this article, we will show you how to make a basic wooden slot device.

To make a wooden slot device, you will need:
- A piece of wood at least 12"x12" in size
- A straight edge or ruler
- Saw (either hand or power)
- Drill or other means of creating a hole in the wood
- Sandpaper (optional)

1. Measure and mark the dimensions for your wooden slot device on the piece of wood. You may want to make it smaller or larger depending on your preferences. For our example, we will be making a slot device that is 6"x6".
2. Cut out the shape of the slot device using a saw. If you are using a hand saw, be careful to ensure that all cuts are straight. If you are using a power saw, be sure to use appropriate safety gear including goggles and a dust mask.
3. Drill a hole in the center of the top of the slot device. This hole will be used to hold the object that you would like to slide through the slot device.
4. Sand down any rough edges on the cut pieces using sandpaper (optional).

In this article, we will show you how to make a wooden slot machine.

This project is a relatively simple one, but it can be a lot of fun and it looks great when finished.

The first thing you need to do is gather the necessary materials. For this project, you will need:

-A piece of wood (about 12”x12”)
-Paint or stain
-A drill with a ¼” bit
-Screws (1” or longer)
-Small nails or screws (3/8” or shorter)
-A jigsaw or a coping saw
-A hammer
-A screwdriver
-Ruler or a straight edge 
-Chisel
-Plywood (optional)
-Double sided tape (optional)

Once you have gathered all of the necessary materials, you can begin construction. The first step is to cut the wood to size. If you are using a piece of plywood, you will need to cut two pieces that are each 12”x12”. If you are using a single piece of wood, you will need to cut it into two pieces that are each 6”x12”. Once the pieces are cut, use a ruler or straight edge to draw lines on the wood that indicate where the slots will be. Make sure that the lines are about 1” apart and that they are evenly spaced. 

 Use a jigsaw or coping saw to cut along the lines that you drew in order to create the slots. If your cuts are not perfectly straight, don't worry – we will fix them in the next step. Once the slots have been cut, use a chisel to clean up the edges. Make sure that all of the edges are smooth and even. Now it is time to drill the holes for the screws. Drill two holes in each piece of wood, one in each end. The holes should be about 3/4" from the edge and should be evenly spaced. The hole should also be big enough for the screws that you are using. Use a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the screws that you are using so that the screws will grip tightly once they are inserted into the hole. 

 Now it is time to assemble the machine. Apply some paint or stain to both pieces of wood and allow them to dry completely. Once they have dried, attach them together using screws. Make sure that the screws are long enough so that they go all of way through both pieces of wood. You may also want to use nails or small screws as well in order to help hold everything together securely . Once everything is assembled, test out the machine by putting some coins into it and seeing if they come out the other side!
