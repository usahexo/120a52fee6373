#  Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware Allow Online Gambling

Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware have all legalized online gambling within their states. This is great news for both the states and the players, as it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.

So what are the specifics of these new laws?

In Nevada, online poker became legal in February 2013. The first site went live in April 2013. Residents of Nevada can play at any of the regulated sites, but they must be physically located in the state to do so. There are currently six sites licensed in Nevada.

New Jersey's new law went into effect in November 2013. It allows both casino games and sports betting to be played online. The first site launched in December 2013. There are currently nine approved sites, including PokerStars NJ, 888 Casino NJ and Betfair Casino NJ. Residents of New Jersey must be located within the state to play on these sites.

Delaware's law went into effect in May 2013. Online poker is the only game allowed, and residents must be physically located within the state to play. There are currently three licensed sites: Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway & Casino and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino.

#  Pennsylvania Joins the States Allowing Online Gambling

Pennsylvania has become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. This comes as a response to the growing popularity of internet gaming and the need for new revenue sources for the government.

The bill, which was passed on October 25th, allows both casino gaming and poker to be played online. Players must be over 21 years of age and located within Pennsylvania borders in order to participate.

The move is seen as a way to help struggling casinos in the state, many of which have been hit hard by competition from neighbouring states that have also legalized gambling. It is hoped that the additional revenue brought in by online gaming will help keep these casinos afloat.

So far, the response to the news has been mixed. Some players are excited about the prospect of being able to gamble from home, while others are concerned about potential fraud and money laundering.

Casino owners are hopeful that this new development will breathe some life into their businesses, but they also recognize that there is some risk involved. Only time will tell how successful this venture will be.

#  More States Likely to Follow Suit and Allow Online Gambling

In the past few years, there‚Äôs been a growing trend of states legalizing different forms of online gambling. This is in direct response to the United States Department of Justice‚Äôs 2011 opinion that the federal Wire Act only applies to sports betting.

Online gambling is now legal in Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. And just last month, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.

Some people are opposed to online gambling, arguing that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. But research suggests that online gambling is no more dangerous than traditional forms of gambling. And in fact, it may be safer because it allows people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes.

Online gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. It can also be a way to make money. If you‚Äôre interested in giving online gambling a try, here are some tips:

üé≤Choose a reputable site: There are many scams out there, so it‚Äôs important to choose a site that‚Äôs reputable and has a good reputation.

üé≤Read the terms and conditions: Make sure you understand the rules and regulations of the site before you start playing.

üé≤Play for fun: Don‚Äôt gamble with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose. Play for fun and excitement, not to make money.

Online gambling can be a lot of fun, but it‚Äôs important to play responsibly. Be aware of the risks involved and don‚Äôt gamble with more money than you can afford to lose. Have fun and good luck!

#  Federal Law Does Not Prevent States From Allowing Online Gambling

In recent years, there has been debate over the legality of online gambling. Some people argue that it is illegal under federal law, while others contend that states have the authority to legalize and regulate the activity. The Department of Justice‚Äôs Office of Legal Counsel recently issued an opinion concluding that federal law does not prevent states from allowing online gambling.

The opinion (issued on September 20, 2018) was in response to a request from the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The Committee asked whether a proposed bill‚Äîthe ‚ÄúRestoration of America‚Äôs Wire Act‚Äù (RAWA)‚Äîwould prohibit states from legalizing online gambling.

The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the RAWA would not prohibit states from legalizing online gambling. In reaching this conclusion, the Office looked at both the text and history of the relevant federal law‚Äîthe Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).

The UIGEA prohibits certain types of financial transactions related to unlawful internet gambling. However, it does not specifically address state-level legalization of online gambling. The Office of Legal Counsel found that Congress‚Äô intent in passing the UIGEA was not to prevent states from legalizing online gambling. Rather, Congress intended to prohibit only unlawful internet gambling activities, which are distinct from lawful state-regulated activities.

The opinion also noted that several states have already legalized some form of online gambling, without any apparent conflict with federal law. Accordingly, the Office concluded that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state regulation of online gambling when it passed the UIGEA.
