#  Fasb Adds Casino-Specific Assistance

In early 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced new guidance designed to help companies with casino operations better report their income and expenses. The amendments aim to provide clarity on the presentation of revenue, costs, and profits from casino gaming activities.

The new guidance applies to all entities that own or operate a casino, and it expands on the presentation of costs and profits from gaming activities in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The amendments also clarify how to account for certain costs and revenues associated with casino gaming operations.

For example, the amendments specify that certain direct costs associated with casino gaming activity should be presented as a component of cost of goods sold (COGS), rather than as an expense item. This includes items such as uniforms, advertising, and compensation for employees who work exclusively in the casino gaming area.

The amendments also address the treatment of complimentary services and items provided to casino customers. For example, they specify that free meals provided to customers should be recorded as a reduction in revenue, rather than as an expense item. In addition, revenues generated by loyalty programs that offer rewards in the form of complimentary items or services should be recorded net of the cost of those rewards.

The goal of these amendments is to provide greater clarity and consistency in the reporting of casino gaming activities. They are based on feedback received from stakeholders during a public comment period, and they will take effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.

#  What casino-specific assistance was added to fasb?

In 1985, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 105, which addressed the accounting and financial reporting for gaming activities. In 2003, the FASB amended this standard with Statement No. 115, which specifically addressed the casino industry. The objectives of this amendment were to improve financial reporting by casinos and to provide more useful information to investors about these entities.

The 2003 amendments to Statement No. 115 made a number of changes to how casinos account for their gaming activities. These changes included:

– Defining a casino as an entity that derives at least 50% of its gross revenues from gambling activities

–excluding from revenue those amounts paid to customers as winnings or prizes
– recognizing revenue only when players are allowed to withdraw funds they have won
– recording promotional allowances as a reduction of revenue
– capitalizing certain costs associated with the acquisition, construction, and development of casino properties
– establishing separate depreciation schedules for buildings and furniture and equipment used in gaming operations.

The 2003 amendments also introduced new disclosure requirements for casinos, including information about:

1) The nature and extent of their gambling operations
2) The methods used to calculate their gaming revenue
3) Certain costs associated with their gambling operations

#  Fasb Adds More Help for Casinos

In a move to help casinos with their troubled financial situations, the FASB has created new rules that will allow them more flexibility in how they report their results. The decision was made in an attempt to make it easier for casinos to restructure their debt and improve their liquidity.

The new rules will allow casinos to exclude certain income and expenses from their calculations. This will give them more breathing room as they work to improve their financial positions. In addition, the FASB has also decided to delay the implementation of new rules that would have made it more difficult for casinos to use net operating losses (NOLs) in order to reduce their taxes.

These changes are expected to benefit both casino operators and lenders who are owed money by these companies. It should help ease some of the pressure that has been building up in the casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.

The new rules were announced on December 15th, just days before Casino gaming company Caesars Entertainment filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This was the third major filing by a casino company this year, and it is clear that the industry is starting to feel the effects of the recession.

While it is still too early to know how much these changes will help, they are a step in the right direction. With any luck, they will be enough to stabilize the casino industry and help it recover from its current troubles.

#  $1 Million in Casino Tax Breaks Approved in Ohio

In a unanimous vote on Wednesday, the Ohio Casino Control Commission approved a measure that will provide $1 million in tax breaks for the state’s four casinos. The tax break is aimed at helping the casinos offset increased competition from new gambling venues in neighboring states.

Under the measure, each of the state’s casinos will be able to claim up to $250,000 in tax relief per year. The total value of the tax breaks will be capped at $1 million, which means that if all four casinos claim their full allotment, they will save a combined total of $1 million per year.

The commission’s vote comes amid heightened competition from new gambling venues in neighboring states. In March, Pennsylvania opened its sixth casino, while Maryland and West Virginia are both in the process of expanding their gambling offerings.

The move is also designed to help create a more level playing field between the state’s four casinos and its racinos, which offer horse racing and slot machines but not table games. The racinos currently enjoy a tax break that allows them to pay a lower tax rate on slot machine revenue than the casinos.

Casino interests had lobbied for a larger tax break, but commission members said that they didn’t want to jeopardize the state’s share of casino revenue.

In fiscal year 2018, casino revenue generated more than $220 million for the state’s general fund.

#  Fasb Boosts Casino Industry with New Rules

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has announced new rules that should boost the casino industry. The new rules, which become effective in 2019, allow casinos to account for breakage on their slot machines as income.

Breakage is defined as the difference between the amount paid by a player and the amount won. Under the old rules, casinos were not allowed to account for breakage as income. This meant that they had to keep track of how much money was lost on each machine, and could only record income when a player hit the jackpot.

The new rules will allow casinos to recognize income as soon as a machine pays out, regardless of whether or not it is a jackpot. This should provide a boost to casino profits, as well as help to attract more investors.

The FASB’s decision was met with mixed reactions from the casino industry. Some believe that it will provide a much-needed boost, while others are concerned that it will lead to over-the-top gambling and create more losers than winners.

Only time will tell how this new ruling will impact the casino industry, but one thing is for sure – it is sure to stir up some excitement!
