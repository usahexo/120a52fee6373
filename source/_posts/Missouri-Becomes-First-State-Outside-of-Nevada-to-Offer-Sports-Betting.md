#  Missouri Becomes First State Outside of Nevada to Offer Sports Betting

On Tuesday, June 5, the Missouri Gaming Commission voted to approve rules permitting sports betting in the state. This made Missouri the first state outside of Nevada to offer sports betting.

The new rules will go into effect on August 28, and will allow casinos in Missouri to offer bettors the chance to wager on professional and college sporting events. The commission will also permit bets on other events, such as elections and reality shows.

Missouri joined a growing number of states that are jumping on the sports betting bandwagon in light of the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn a federal ban on the activity. The court’s ruling opened the door for states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

So far, 10 states have legalized some form of sports betting, although only five have implemented regulatory frameworks for it. In addition to Missouri and Nevada, those states are Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

Casinos in Missouri anticipate that sports betting will be a major draw for customers. “It’s something that’s going to bring people in that may not have come in before,” said Joe Weinberg, owner of Tropicana Evansville casino in Indiana and president of its parent company.

Missouri officials expect that gambling revenue from sports betting will be about $10 million per year. That is a small fraction of the state’s overall gambling revenue, which was nearly $2 billion in 2017. But it is still seen as an important new stream of income for casinos and other businesses involved in gambling.

Opponents of legalizing sports betting say that it increases the likelihood of gambling addiction and other negative outcomes. But supporters argue that it is no different than other forms of gambling and can be regulated to protect consumers.

#  Pennsylvania Becomes Second State to Offer Sports Betting, Joining Nevada and Missouri

On October 26, Pennsylvania became the second state to legalize sports betting since the US Supreme Court overturned the federal prohibition on the activity in May. The move makes Pennsylvania the seventh state to allow some form of legalized sports gambling.

The Keystone State's new law allows licensed casinos, racetracks, and online betting operators to take wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events. The law imposes a 36% tax on gaming revenue generated from sports betting, which is expected to bring in an estimated $100 million in its first year.

Pennsylvania was one of six states that asked the Supreme Court to review the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which effectively banned sports betting nationwide. In a 6-3 ruling, the justices sided with New Jersey and struck down PASPA as unconstitutional.

Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize sports gambling, including Nevada, Missouri, Delaware, Rhode Island, New York, and West Virginia. At least 22 other states are considering similar measures.

 supporters argue that legalizing sports betting will help generate much-needed revenue for state governments. Casino operators and other interested businesses also see it as a potentially lucrative opportunity.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased addiction and gambling problems, as well as corruption in sport. They also maintain that it is hypocritical for the US government to allow Las Vegas casinos to offer legal sports betting while prohibiting it elsewhere in the country.

#  Delaware Becomes Third State to Offer Sports Betting, Joining Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Delaware

On Tuesday, May 15th, Delaware became the third state to offer legalized sports betting, joining Nevada and Pennsylvania as states with approved legislation.

The legalization of sports betting in Delaware came after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports gambling outside of Nevada in a ruling handed down in May 2018. Delaware was one of six states that had already passed legislation in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

According to newly-appointed Delaware Governor John Carney, “This is a great day for Delaware, and we’re thrilled to have this new opportunity to generate revenue for our state and create jobs in the process.”

Delaware’s new sports betting industry is poised to bring in an estimated $7 million annually in tax revenue, with prospects for even more growth down the road. The Dover Downs casino will be the primary venue for sports betting in Delaware, offering both online and on-site wagering options.

In addition to Dover Downs, three other casinos – Harrington Raceway and Casino, Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino, and Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin – will also offer sports betting within the next few weeks. Betting on NFL games will be available at all locations starting on Thursday, September 6th.

The US Supreme Court’s ruling has opened up the door for other states to legalize sports betting as well. So far, at least 10 states are considering similar measures.

#  New Jersey Officially Opens Sports Betting; online and land-based operators see intense demand

This week, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement released figures that showed that the state’s sports betting market is off to a roaring start. In the first week of legal sports betting in the Garden State,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) operators reported taking in more than $9.1 million in bets.

The demand for sports betting was intense across all formats, with online and land-based operators seeing brisk business. Of the $9.1 million taken in, nearly 80% was wagered through online platforms.

The major beneficiaries of this early surge in business have been Atlantic City’s casinos, which accounted for over 60% of all sports bets placed in the state. Borgata and Ocean Resort Casino led the pack, accounting for almost half of all bets placed in New Jersey.

It’s still too early to tell whether this level of interest will be sustained over time, but one thing is clear – New Jersey has emerged as a leading player in the rapidly growing US sports betting market.

#  Rhode Island Could be Next State to Legalize Sports Gambling

After the US Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports gambling in May, individual states have been taking up the issue of whether to legalize the activity within their borders. So far, New Jersey has led the way in establishing a regulated sports betting market, but other states are close behind.

Now Rhode Island may be ready to join the fray. The state's Senate has passed a bill that would legalize sports betting, and Governor Gina Raimondo has said she is open to signing it into law. There are still some hurdles to overcome; the bill must pass the House of Representatives and then be approved by voters in a referendum. But if it all comes together, Rhode Island would become the second state, after New Jersey, to allow sports betting.

The legalization of sports betting is seen as a way to bring in new revenue for states. In Rhode Island, for example, estimates suggest that legalizing sports betting could generate up to $23 million in annual revenue. That would be a welcome addition to the state's coffers; its budget shortfall is projected to be about $200 million this year.

Legalizing sports betting could also create jobs in Rhode Island. The casinos and other businesses that would offer sports betting would need employees to operate their operations. And those employees would likely spend their money in the local economy, providing a boost to businesses there.

Not everyone is happy about the prospect of legalized sports betting, of course. Some people worry that it will lead to addiction and other social ills. But such concerns can be addressed through regulation and education. Overall, it seems that the benefits of legalizing sports gambling outweigh the risks.

Rhode Island may not be at the forefront of legalization efforts anymore, but it looks like it could be jumping on board soon. With its budget woes and potential for new jobs and revenue, Rhode Island has a lot to gain from legalizing sports betting.
