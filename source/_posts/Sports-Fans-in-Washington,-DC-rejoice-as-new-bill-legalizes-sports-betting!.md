#  Sports Fans in Washington, DC rejoice as new bill legalizes sports betting!

Senate Bill 1116, also known as the Sports Gaming Act of 2018 was just signed into law by Governor Ralph Northam last week and will go into effect starting on October 1st. This new bill legalizes sports betting in the state of Virginia, giving residents the green light to bet on their favorite teams both online and at physical sportsbooks.

While other states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania have been reaping the benefits of legalized sports betting for some time now, many residents in Virginia are eagerly anticipating the start of October when they can finally place their bets. Fans of all major professional sports teams (Washington Redskins, Washington Nationals, Washington Capitals) can now enjoy placing bets on games not only during the season but also throughout the offseason.

 Proponents of the bill argue that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents believe that it will only serve to exacerbate gambling addiction problems. Only time will tell who is right, but in the meantime Washingtonians can prepare to make some interesting wagers!

#  Washington, DC poised to become a major hub for sports betting!

The nation’s capital is gearing up to become a major sports betting destination, as the city council voted unanimously to legalize the activity. The measure will now go before the full city council for a vote, and if approved, Washington would become one of the few jurisdictions in the United States to allow single-game sports betting.

Under the proposed legislation, operators would be able to offer sports betting at physical locations in Washington, as well as online. The measure also stipulates that betting on collegiate and high school sporting events would be prohibited.

Councilmember Jack Evans, who sponsored the bill, is confident that it will be passed by the full city council. “It’s a landmark bill that allows for brick-and-mortar and online gaming, which is something that our city needs desperately,” said Evans.

The District of Columbia already has a well-established casino industry, with three casinos operating in the city. However, these venues are only permitted to offer table games and slot machines. If the new bill is passed, Washington would join a small number of jurisdictions in the United States that allow sports betting.

Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court decision earlier this year that struck down a federal ban on the activity. Since then, Delaware and New Jersey have also legalized sports betting, while West Virginia and Pennsylvania are in the process of doing so.

Washington’s move comes as no surprise considering how lucrative legal sports betting can be. In Nevada alone, sports betting generated more than $250 million in revenue in 2017. It’s estimated that if Washington were to legalize sports betting, it could generate up to $13 million in annual tax revenue.

#  New legislation paves way for legalized athletics betting in Washington, DC!

On Tuesday, November 26th, the Washington, DC city council unanimously passed legislation that will pave the way for legalized athletics betting in the district. This is a major step forward for the city, as it now becomes one of the few jurisdictions in the country to allow such betting.

The new legislation allows for sports betting at licensed venues such as casinos and racetracks. It also permits online betting, which is sure to be a popular option among residents and visitors to the district. In addition to traditional sports such as football and basketball, bets can be placed on other events such as golf and NASCAR.

Supporters of the legislation argue that it will generate significant revenue for the city. They also believe that it will help create jobs and promote tourism. Critics of the measure say that it could lead to addiction and other social ills.

Regardless of these concerns, it is clear that this move by the DC city council represents a major shift in policy with regard to gambling. It will be interesting to see how things play out in the district going forward, and whether or not other jurisdictions follow suit.

#  Get ready to bet on the Washington Wizards and Capitals – athletics betting now legal in DC!

The Washington Wizards and Capitals will now be the main focus of the District of Columbia’s sports betting scene. The legalization of sports betting in the district on Monday has drawn attention to the teams, which have largely flown under the radar in a city that is focused on football and basketball.

Both the Wizards and Capitals have been successful in recent years, but they have yet to win a championship. In the 2006-07 season, the Wizards went 44-38 and reached the playoffs but were eliminated in the first round. The Capitals went 49-24-9 that season and reached the Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Detroit Red Wings.

In more recent seasons, both teams have been more successful. The Wizards went 43-39 in 2016-17 and reached the playoffs but were eliminated in the second round. The Capitals went 55-19-8 last season and won their first Stanley Cup.

Washington D.C. is not alone in its interest in these two teams; legal sports betting is also available in New Jersey for both teams, as well as Pennsylvania for the Capitals only. There could be some interesting betting matchups available for these two teams, including:

*Wizards vs Celtics – This rivalry has heated up recently, with each team winning a playoff series against one another over the past few seasons. With Kyrie Irving now playing for Boston, this should be an exciting matchup to watch.

*Capitals vs Penguins – These two teams have met twice in the playoffs over the past three seasons, with each team winning one series. Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin are two of the best players in the league, so this matchup is always exciting to watch.

*Wizards vs Lakers – This matchup would likely draw a lot of interest from bettors because of LeBron James’ move to Los Angeles this offseason. It will be interesting to see how James does in his first year with the Lakers against one of his former rivals in Washington D.C.
