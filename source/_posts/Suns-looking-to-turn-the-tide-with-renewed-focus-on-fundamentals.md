#  Suns looking to turn the tide with renewed focus on fundamentals

In the offseason, the Phoenix Suns made wholesale changes to their coaching staff and front office in an effort to right the ship. These changes came after a third consecutive season in which the Suns failed to reach the playoffs.

One of the main focuses for new head coach Igor Kokoskov and his staff is to get the team back to playing fundamental basketball. This involves emphasizing things like player movement, spacing, and ball movement.

"Igor has instilled a new culture and a new way of doing things," said guard Devin Booker. "We're really focusing on getting better defensively and moving the ball more."

The Suns have gotten off to a good start this season, winning four of their first six games. This includes impressive wins over Dallas and Oklahoma City.

"I think we've been doing a good job of moving the ball and getting everyone involved," said center Deandre Ayton. "It's been fun playing that way."

While it is still early, it looks like the Suns' renewed focus on fundamentals is starting to pay off. With continued improvement, they could be poised for a playoff run this season.

#  3 keys to getting your poker game up to par like the Suns

If you want to improve your poker game, it's important to focus on three key areas: your mindset, your skillset, and the way you play. Here are three tips that can help you get on the right track.

1. Mindset

Your mindset is crucial when it comes to poker. You need to be focused and stay in the moment if you want to be successful. When you're playing poker, don't let negative thoughts or emotions get in the way. Stay positive and confident, and keep your eye on the prize.

2. Skillset

In order to improve your skillset, you need to practice regularly and learn from your mistakes. Study the game inside out and pay attention to what other players are doing. Figure out what works for you and what doesn't, and make adjustments accordingly.

3. Gameplay

The way you play poker can have a big impact on your results. Try to be aggressive when it's warranted, but also be aware of your limitations. Don't take unnecessary risks, but also be willing to make big bets when the time is right. In short, play smart and play to win.

#  Suns take a beating, but refuse to fold (poker pun intended)

The Phoenix Suns were steamrolled by the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, losing by a score of 130-103. It was a one-sided affair from the start, with the Warriors leading by as many as 34 points in the second half.

Despite the lopsided score, the Suns refused to give up. They outscored the Warriors in the final period, and showed plenty of fight in the process. Devin Booker led Phoenix with 32 points on 11-of-23 shooting, while TJ Warren added 23 points and 10 rebounds.

Overall, it was a disappointing performance from the Suns. But there were some positives to take away from it, namely Booker's individual effort and Warren's all-around play.

The Suns will look to get back on track when they host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night.

#  Poker faces: How the Suns use mental toughness for on-the-field success

The Phoenix Suns had a rough season in 2016-2017. After losing starting point guard Eric Bledsoe to the Milwaukee Bucks in November, the Suns went on to finish with the worst record in the Western Conference. However, head coach Earl Watson saw something special in this group of players, and he attributes their success to their mental toughness.

"Mental toughness is our staple," Watson said. "It's who we are. We've been through so much adversity over the last few years, and that has made us mentally tough."

Adversity is nothing new for this Suns team. In fact, they've become experts at overcoming it. In 2013-2014, they finished with the second worst record in the Western Conference, but they were able to bounce back and make it to the playoffs just two years later. And last season was even more challenging, as they had to deal with not only the departure of Bledsoe, but also injuries to stars Devin Booker and Brandon Knight.

But through it all, the Suns have remained focused and determined. "Our mindset is always to play hard and never give up," said rookie Josh Jackson. "No matter what the score is or how bad things seem, we're always going to fight."

That attitude has been crucial for this young team, and it will be instrumental in their success moving forward. With Booker and Jackson leading the way, the Suns are poised for a comeback season in 2017-2018.

#  Suns put in the work to raise their poker game

The Phoenix Suns have been one of the more disappointing teams in the NBA this season. They currently sit at 9-27 and are in last place in the Western Conference. However, there are signs that the Suns are starting to put things together, and their play at the poker table is one of them.

Phoenix has been one of the better teams in poker this season. They are currently ranked 4th in the league with a 55.98% win rate. This is thanks in part to some of their players stepping up their game.

Devin Booker has been one of the best players for Phoenix at the poker table this season. He is currently ranked 3rd in the league with a win rate of 59.26%. Booker has been a big part of the Suns’ success at the table this season and will need to continue playing at a high level if they want to make a run at the playoffs.

Another player who has been playing well for Phoenix is TJ Warren. Warren is ranked 8th in the league with a win rate of 57.14%. He has been a big part of the Suns’ offense this season and has been able to pull down some big wins at the poker table.

Overall, the Suns have been playing well at the poker table this season. Their 55.98% win rate puts them 4th in the league, and they have several players who are playing well. If they can continue to play like this, they should be able to make a playoff push down the stretch.
