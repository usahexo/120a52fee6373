#  How to Replace Tuning Knobs on an Epiphone Casino

The Epiphone Casino is a popular guitar for several reasons: its affordability, its historic association with the Beatles, and its versatile sound. The Casino can be easily tuned using the tuning knobs located on the headstock. Sometimes, however, these knobs may need to be replaced due to wear and tear.

The first step in replacing the tuning knobs on an Epiphone Casino is to remove the strings. This can be done by loosening the tuners and pulling the strings out of the corresponding holes. The next step is to remove the old tuning knobs. This can be done by unscrewing them or by prying them off with a flathead screwdriver.

Once the old tuning knobs have been removed, it is necessary to install new ones. This can be done by screwing them into place or by pressing them into place with a flathead screwdriver. Once they are in place, it is necessary to reattach the strings. This can be done by threading them through the corresponding holes and tightening the tuners.

It is important to note that there is a right and a wrong way to attach strings to an Epiphone Casino. The correct way is to have the string wrap around the tuning post once before tightening the tuner. If the string is wrapped around twice, it will create too much tension on the post and may damage it over time.

Once the tuning knob is removed, you can take off the cap that conceals the screw that holds the knob in place. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove this screw and take off the knob.

The last step is to reattach the cap that conceals the screw and screw in place the new tuning knob. Make sure that you tighten down this screw securely or else your newly repaired tuning knob will come loose again!

There are a few steps in this process. I will start by saying that it is not a difficult process but it will require some patience and dexterity.

The first step is to remove the strings. For this, you will need a Phillips screwdriver. unscrew the six screws on the back of the guitar that hold the cover in place. Once these screws are removed, carefully lift the cover off of the guitar. You should now see the tuning machines and tuner posts.

The next step is to remove the old tuning knob. For this, you will need a small needle-nose pliers. Grasp the knob with the pliers and twist it counterclockwise until it comes off. Set the knob aside for later use.

The new tuning knob can now be installed. Simply place it over the tuner post and twist it clockwise until it is tight. Do not over-tighten, as this can strip the post and ruin the tuning knob.

Now replace the cover on the guitar and re-attach the six screws that hold it in place. Replace the strings and tune up your guitar!
