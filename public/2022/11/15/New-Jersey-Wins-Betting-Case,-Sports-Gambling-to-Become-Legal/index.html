        <h1 id="New-Jersey-Wins-Betting-Case-Sports-Gambling-to-Become-Legal"><a href="#New-Jersey-Wins-Betting-Case-Sports-Gambling-to-Become-Legal" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Wins Betting Case, Sports Gambling to Become Legal"></a>New Jersey Wins Betting Case, Sports Gambling to Become Legal</h1><p>The US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the federal law banning sports betting is unconstitutional, opening up the door for states to legalize sports gambling.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the state that brought the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the federal law violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves powers not given to the federal government to the states.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion that “the prohibition on express Sports Gambling with respect to amateur and professional Sports is unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>“Congress cannot compel states to keep laws on the books that it believes are foolish,” he added.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the value of the U.S. sports betting market at $150 billion, of which only a tiny fraction is currently bet illegally.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said in a statement “I am thrilled that our state can now move forward with plans to provide much-needed revenue to our casinos and racetracks, and create new jobs in our state.”</p>
<p>New Jersey is not alone in moving to legalize sports gambling. PASPA has been on shaky ground for some time, with a number of states having already taken steps towards legalization. In 2014, New York and Colorado both introduced bills to regulate and tax sports betting if PASPA was overturned. And in 2016, Mississippi passed a bill that would allow casinos in the state to offer legal sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Major-Victory-for-New-Jersey-as-Sports-Gambling-Becomes-Legal"><a href="#Major-Victory-for-New-Jersey-as-Sports-Gambling-Becomes-Legal" class="headerlink" title="Major Victory for New Jersey as Sports Gambling Becomes Legal"></a>Major Victory for New Jersey as Sports Gambling Becomes Legal</h1><p>In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the federal ban on sports gambling is unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for New Jersey and other states to legalize and regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>The 5-4 ruling overturns the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), which had prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling. The case was brought by New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, stating that PASPA “violates the anti-commandeering principle” laid out in the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution. The 10th Amendment prohibits the federal government from forcing states to act on its behalf.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter, writing that PASPA “neither infringes state sovereignty nor violates federalism.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hailed the decision as a “major victory for New Jersey and for our democracy,” and said it would “bring much-needed revenue to our state and create thousands of jobs.”</p>
<p>Senator Cory Booker, who introduced legislation in Congress to repeal PASPA in 2017, called the ruling a “big win for New Jersey and states’ rights.” He predicted that it would lead to a “fundamental change in how wesports wager in America.”</p>
<p>The gambling industry is expected to grow rapidly following Monday’s ruling. Gambling analysts estimate that legal sports betting could be worth up to $150 billion per year in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Finally-Legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Finally-Legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Finally Legal in New Jersey"></a>Sports Gambling Finally Legal in New Jersey</h1><p>After years of legal battles and back-and-forth deliberations, sports gambling is finally legal in the state of New Jersey. This marks a major victory for supporters of legalized sports gambling, who have long argued that it would generate much-needed revenue for states and create jobs.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting in New Jersey has been a long time coming. In 2012, the state passed a bill legalizing sports gambling, but it was quickly challenged by the NCAA and major professional sports leagues. The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of New Jersey in May 2018.</p>
<p>Now that sports gambling is legal in New Jersey, what does that mean for residents and businesses? Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sports gambling will be available at casinos and racetracks throughout the state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be a variety of betting options available, including point spreads, moneylines, and over&#x2F;under bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling on college games is not allowed, but gamblers can bet on games between professional teams from different states.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minimum age for betting is 21 years old.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tax rates for gambling winnings will vary depending on the amount won. Wagers up to $5,000 will be subject to a tax rate of 8.5%, while amounts over $5,000 will be taxed at 13%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any form of gambling, there are risks involved. Before you decide to wager on your favorite team, make sure you understand the risks and how to manage them. Also be sure to consult with an attorney or other legal professional if you have any questions about how sports betting works in New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Poised-to-Capitalize-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Poised-to-Capitalize-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Poised to Capitalize on Newly Legalized Sports Gambling"></a>New Jersey Poised to Capitalize on Newly Legalized Sports Gambling</h1><p>The 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 has cleared the way for states to legalize sports gambling within their borders, and New Jersey is wasting no time in taking advantage of the ruling.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy announced on Thursday that he had signed into law a bill allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey, making his state the second in the nation (after Delaware) to offer legal sports wagering.</p>
<p>Sports gambling had been outlawed in New Jersey since 1992, when Congress passed PASPA in response to concerns that organized crime was infiltrating the gaming industry. But with the Supreme Court’s ruling last month, New Jersey is now free to pursue its own policy on sports betting, and officials there are eager to get started.</p>
<p>“Today is a great day for the people of New Jersey,” said Governor Murphy at a signing ceremony held at Monmouth Park Racetrack. “This new law will bring much-needed revenue to our state, create thousands of new jobs, and support our local businesses.”</p>
<p>New Jersey officials are estimating that legalized sports gambling could generate up to $500 million in annual revenue for the state, most of which would be earmarked for property tax relief. In addition, they predict that the legalization of sports betting will create more than 9,000 jobs in the casino and racing industries alone.</p>
<p>Casinos and race tracks across New Jersey are already gearing up for legalization, installing new software and hiring new staff in anticipation of a surge in betting activity. And while other states are also moving to legalize sports gambling, New Jersey is well positioned to benefit from its head start.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to offer our customers this new form of entertainment,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of Tropicana Entertainment Inc., one of Atlantic City’s largest casino operators. “We expect sports betting will be very popular in New Jersey, and we’re committed to providing our customers with a world-class experience.”</p>
<p>So far there has been little opposition to legalized sports betting in New Jersey, with most lawmakers and residents seeing it as a way to generate much-needed revenue for the state. There are some who are concerned about potential problems associated with gambling addiction, but these seem likely to be overshadowed by the benefits that legalized sports wagering can bring.</p>
<h1 id="Welcome-to-the-Future-Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Welcome-to-the-Future-Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Welcome to the Future: Sports Gambling is Now Legal in New Jersey"></a>Welcome to the Future: Sports Gambling is Now Legal in New Jersey</h1><p>On Monday, June 11th, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in the case of Murphy v. NCAA, striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional. This monumental ruling paves the way for states to legalize sports gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Immediately following the news of the ruling, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey announced that sports betting would be legalized in the Garden State within weeks. “Today’s ruling is a victory for New Jersey and for all Americans who believe in the principle of state’s rights,” said Governor Murphy. “I am proud to say that we fought hard for this day and I am confident that our casinos and racetracks will offer a safe, entertaining and regulated sports betting experience that will be second to none.”</p>
<p>New Jersey has been fighting to overturn PASPA since 2011, when then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law legalizing sports betting in the state. However, the law was challenged by the NCAA and major professional sports leagues, who argued that it violated PASPA. The case made its way all the way to the Supreme Court, where a majority of justices agreed with New Jersey that PASPA violated state sovereignty rights under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>With PASPA now overturned, other states are likely to follow suit and legalize sports betting within their borders. This could lead to a massive expansion of the multibillion-dollar global sports gambling industry. Experts are predicting that legal sports betting could bring in up to $6 billion annually in tax revenue for states that choose to legalize it.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion on gambling may be, there’s no denying that this is a landmark decision with far-reaching implications. The future of sports gambling is now murky territory, with various states likely to legalize it in different ways. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out in the coming months and years. Welcome to the future: Sports gambling is now legal in New Jersey!</p>
