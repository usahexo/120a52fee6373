Wagering addiction can be extremely harmful to both the addict and their loved ones, so it is important to take steps to help them get better as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The first step is to try and understand what is driving the addiction. oftentimes, people turn to wagering as a way to escape from their problems or cope with negative emotions. It can be helpful for the addict to explore these issues and find healthier ways to deal with them.</p>
<p>You can also help the addict by creating a supportive environment. This means being understanding and non-judgemental, and also keeping track of their spending so that they don’t overspend on gambling. It is also important to set reasonable boundaries and stick to them. For example, you might not want to allow the addict to gamble online if they are trying to recover from an addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important for the addict to seek professional help. There are many programs available that can help people overcome a wagering addiction. With treatment, most people are able to overcome their addiction and live healthy, happy lives.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Deal-with-a-Wagering-Addict-in-your-Life"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-a-Wagering-Addict-in-your-Life" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with a Wagering Addict in your Life"></a>How to Deal with a Wagering Addict in your Life</h1><p>If you have a wagering addict in your life, you may be feeling overwhelmed and helpless. You may not know how to help them or even if there is anything you can do. Wagering addiction can be a difficult addiction to overcome, but there are ways that you can help your loved one get the treatment they need.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to understand the signs of a wagering addiction. Some common symptoms include lying about money, gambling more than intended, hiding gambling activity, borrowing money from others to gamble, and selling possessions to gamble. If you see these signs in your loved one, it is important to get them help right away.</p>
<p>You can help your loved one by finding them an accredited treatment center that specializes in wagering addiction treatment. There are currently no medications available to treat wagering addiction, so treatment relies heavily on therapy and support groups. It is important for the addict to be willing to seek treatment and for family members to be supportive during the entire process.</p>
<p>In addition to seeking professional help, there are things that you can do at home to help your loved one. This includes setting rules about gambling and sticking to them, monitoring their activities, and staying positive and supportive. It is also important not to enable the addict’s behaviour in any way – this includes giving them money or helping them cover up their gambling activity.</p>
<p>Wagering addiction can be a difficult addiction to overcome, but with the help of family and friends, it is possible. By understanding the signs of a problem and getting your loved one into treatment, you can help them overcome their addiction and start living a healthy life.</p>

Friends can be an important support system for helping addicts to overcome their addiction and return to healthy lives.</p>
<p>Addicts often feel ashamed and embarrassed about their addiction, leading them to withdraw from social activities and isolate themselves from friends and family. It can be hard for loved ones to watch someone they care about suffer, but it is important to remember that addicts need love and support during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Friends can provide crucial support by helping addicts to stay accountable, providing emotional support, and reminding them of their goals for recovery. Addicts often find it helpful to have a friend who is also in recovery so they can share experiences and offer mutual support.</p>
<p>There are many resources available to help friends support their loved ones through gambling addiction recovery. The National Council on Problem Gambling offers a variety of programs and services designed to help addicts and their families, including a national helpline (1-800-522-4700) that provides counseling and referrals.</p>
<p>Friends are an important part of the recovery process for gambling addicts. With the right support, addicts can overcome their addiction and rebuild their lives.</p>

<ol>
<li>Seek professional help.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is always the first step, as professional help can provide guidance and support through the recovery process. There are many different types of professionals who can help with gambling addiction, such as therapists, psychiatrists, and counselors.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Join a support group.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many groups available to Gamblers Anonymous (GA), which is a 12-step program that helps people overcome their addiction to gambling. Joining a GA group can provide support from others who understand what you’re going through and can offer helpful advice.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove yourself from temptation.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have trouble resisting the urge to gamble, it may be helpful to remove yourself from situations and places where gambling is readily available. This includes staying away from casinos, online poker sites, and other places where gambling is common. It may also be helpful to delete any gambling-related apps from your phone or computer.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set limits and stick to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do choose to gamble, it’s important to set limits on how much money you’re willing to lose and then stick to those limits. Gambling responsibly can prevent you from spending more money than you intended or becoming emotionally attached to your bets.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Use positive reinforcement instead of punishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>When trying to overcome a gambling problem, it’s important not to use punishment as a way of dealing with negative behaviors associated with gambling. This can only add stress and frustration and will likely not be effective in the long run. Instead, use positive reinforcement such as rewards for meeting goals or milestones in your recovery process</p>
<h1 id="How-to-solve-gambling-problems-Curie-within-few-simple-steps"><a href="#How-to-solve-gambling-problems-Curie-within-few-simple-steps" class="headerlink" title="How to solve gambling problems Curie within few simple steps"></a>How to solve gambling problems Curie within few simple steps</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can ruin people’s lives. If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, there are steps you can take to get help.</p>
<p>The first step is to admit that you have a problem. Gambling addiction can be difficult to overcome, but it is possible with the right help.</p>
<p>Next, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional about your gambling problem. They can help you find the best treatment for you.</p>
<p>There are many different types of treatment for gambling addiction, including counseling, medication, and therapy.</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble quitting gambling on your own, consider joining a support group or therapy group. These groups can offer emotional support and guidance as you work to overcome your addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, be patient and stay positive. It may take time to overcome your gambling addiction, but with hard work and determination, you can do it.</p>
<h1 id="Solution-of-gambling-problems-Curie-by-following-some-tips"><a href="#Solution-of-gambling-problems-Curie-by-following-some-tips" class="headerlink" title="Solution of gambling problems Curie by following some tips"></a>Solution of gambling problems Curie by following some tips</h1><p>Almost everyone has heard of gambling problems and how they can ruin lives, but what can be done to prevent them? Solutions do exist and by following some tips, gambling problems can be avoided. </p>
<p>It is important to set limits on gambling and only gamble what you can afford to lose. Gambling should never be done as a way to make money or pay bills. Also, avoid chasing losses by increasing the amount of money being gambled. This will only lead to bigger losses in the long run. </p>
<p>Another key tip is to self-exclude from online casinos and other gambling venues if there is a history of gambling problems. This will help to prevent any further gambling from taking place. Finally, get help if needed. There are many support groups available for those with gambling problems as well as counsellors who can help get things back on track. </p>
<p>The most important thing is to take action early if there are any signs of a developing gambling problem. Ignoring the problem will only make it worse in the long run.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Reach out to others who are struggling with gambling problems</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">

        <h1 id="Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-Allow-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-New-Jersey-and-Delaware-Allow-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware Allow Online Gambling"></a>Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware Allow Online Gambling</h1><p>Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware have all legalized online gambling within their states. This is great news for both the states and the players, as it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>So what are the specifics of these new laws?</p>
<p>In Nevada, online poker became legal in February 2013. The first site went live in April 2013. Residents of Nevada can play at any of the regulated sites, but they must be physically located in the state to do so. There are currently six sites licensed in Nevada.</p>
<p>New Jersey’s new law went into effect in November 2013. It allows both casino games and sports betting to be played online. The first site launched in December 2013. There are currently nine approved sites, including PokerStars NJ, 888 Casino NJ and Betfair Casino NJ. Residents of New Jersey must be located within the state to play on these sites.</p>
<p>Delaware’s law went into effect in May 2013. Online poker is the only game allowed, and residents must be physically located within the state to play. There are currently three licensed sites: Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino and Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Joins-the-States-Allowing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Joins-the-States-Allowing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Joins the States Allowing Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Joins the States Allowing Online Gambling</h1><p>Pennsylvania has become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. This comes as a response to the growing popularity of internet gaming and the need for new revenue sources for the government.</p>
<p>The bill, which was passed on October 25th, allows both casino gaming and poker to be played online. Players must be over 21 years of age and located within Pennsylvania borders in order to participate.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a way to help struggling casinos in the state, many of which have been hit hard by competition from neighbouring states that have also legalized gambling. It is hoped that the additional revenue brought in by online gaming will help keep these casinos afloat.</p>
<p>So far, the response to the news has been mixed. Some players are excited about the prospect of being able to gamble from home, while others are concerned about potential fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>Casino owners are hopeful that this new development will breathe some life into their businesses, but they also recognize that there is some risk involved. Only time will tell how successful this venture will be.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Likely-to-Follow-Suit-and-Allow-Online-Gambling"><a href="#More-States-Likely-to-Follow-Suit-and-Allow-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="More States Likely to Follow Suit and Allow Online Gambling"></a>More States Likely to Follow Suit and Allow Online Gambling</h1><p>In the past few years, there’s been a growing trend of states legalizing different forms of online gambling. This is in direct response to the United States Department of Justice’s 2011 opinion that the federal Wire Act only applies to sports betting.</p>
<p>Online gambling is now legal in Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. And just last month, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online gambling. Other states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
<p>Some people are opposed to online gambling, arguing that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. But research suggests that online gambling is no more dangerous than traditional forms of gambling. And in fact, it may be safer because it allows people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p>Online gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. It can also be a way to make money. If you’re interested in giving online gambling a try, here are some tips:</p>
<p>🎲Choose a reputable site: There are many scams out there, so it’s important to choose a site that’s reputable and has a good reputation.</p>
<p>🎲Read the terms and conditions: Make sure you understand the rules and regulations of the site before you start playing.</p>
<p>🎲Play for fun: Don’t gamble with money you can’t afford to lose. Play for fun and excitement, not to make money.</p>
<p>Online gambling can be a lot of fun, but it’s important to play responsibly. Be aware of the risks involved and don’t gamble with more money than you can afford to lose. Have fun and good luck!</p>
<h1 id="Federal-Law-Does-Not-Prevent-States-From-Allowing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Federal-Law-Does-Not-Prevent-States-From-Allowing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Federal Law Does Not Prevent States From Allowing Online Gambling"></a>Federal Law Does Not Prevent States From Allowing Online Gambling</h1><p>In recent years, there has been debate over the legality of online gambling. Some people argue that it is illegal under federal law, while others contend that states have the authority to legalize and regulate the activity. The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel recently issued an opinion concluding that federal law does not prevent states from allowing online gambling.</p>
<p>The opinion (issued on September 20, 2018) was in response to a request from the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The Committee asked whether a proposed bill—the “Restoration of America’s Wire Act” (RAWA)—would prohibit states from legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>The Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the RAWA would not prohibit states from legalizing online gambling. In reaching this conclusion, the Office looked at both the text and history of the relevant federal law—the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).</p>
<p>The UIGEA prohibits certain types of financial transactions related to unlawful internet gambling. However, it does not specifically address state-level legalization of online gambling. The Office of Legal Counsel found that Congress’ intent in passing the UIGEA was not to prevent states from legalizing online gambling. Rather, Congress intended to prohibit only unlawful internet gambling activities, which are distinct from lawful state-regulated activities.</p>
<p>The opinion also noted that several states have already legalized some form of online gambling, without any apparent conflict with federal law. Accordingly, the Office concluded that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state regulation of online gambling when it passed the UIGEA.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-9-Says-that-Allowed-Online-Gambling"><a href="#What-are-the-9-Says-that-Allowed-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What are the 9 Says that Allowed Online Gambling?"></a>What are the 9 Says that Allowed Online Gambling?</h1><p>Online gambling is an umbrella term that refers to any type of gambling conducted over the internet. This can include casino games, sports betting, bingo, and lotteries. There are many different laws governing online gambling around the world, with some countries allowing it and others prohibiting it altogether.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a look at nine countries that allow online gambling. We will explain the laws governing online gambling in each country and discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks of allowing it.</p>
<ol>
<li>The United States</li>
</ol>
<p>The United States is one of the few countries where online gambling is illegal at the federal level. However, this does not mean that Americans cannot gamble online. There are several states where online gambling is legal, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. These states have their own laws regulating online gambling and these laws vary from state to state.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The United Kingdom</li>
</ol>
<p>The United Kingdom is one of the most permissive countries when it comes to online gambling. There are no federal restrictions on online gambling, and individual UK states have their own regulations regarding it. Gambling websites operated by UK companies are licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission. This body ensures that all operators offer a safe and fair gaming experience to their customers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Malta</li>
</ol>
<p>Malta is a Mediterranean island nation that is home to some of the world’s largest online gambling companies. In fact, 85% of all online casinos are licensed in Malta. This is because Malta has a very favorable regulatory environment for online gambling providers. The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) is the government agency responsible for regulating the industry. It licenses operators and ensures that they meet strict safety and security standards.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Gibraltar</li>
</ol>
<p>Gibraltar is another well-known global hotspot for online gambling regulation. This British Overseas Territory has been licensing and regulating casinos since 1998 . The Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner oversees all aspects of the industry, from licensing to advertising to customer protection measures . Like Malta, Gibraltar imposes high safety and security standards on its licensed operators .</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Denmark</li>
</ol>
<p>Denmark was one of the first countries in the world to legalize online gambling . The Danish Gambling Act was passed in 2012 , making it legal for Danish citizens to gamble on websites licensed outside of Denmark . The Danish Gambling Authority (DGA) is responsible for regulating both domestic and foreign-based casinos . It requires all licensees to adhere to strict codes of conduct , including measures to prevent underage gambling and money laundering .</p>

        <h1 id="New-Jersey-Wins-Betting-Case-Sports-Gambling-to-Become-Legal"><a href="#New-Jersey-Wins-Betting-Case-Sports-Gambling-to-Become-Legal" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Wins Betting Case, Sports Gambling to Become Legal"></a>New Jersey Wins Betting Case, Sports Gambling to Become Legal</h1><p>The US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the federal law banning sports betting is unconstitutional, opening up the door for states to legalize sports gambling.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the state that brought the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the federal law violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves powers not given to the federal government to the states.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion that “the prohibition on express Sports Gambling with respect to amateur and professional Sports is unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>“Congress cannot compel states to keep laws on the books that it believes are foolish,” he added.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the value of the U.S. sports betting market at $150 billion, of which only a tiny fraction is currently bet illegally.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey said in a statement “I am thrilled that our state can now move forward with plans to provide much-needed revenue to our casinos and racetracks, and create new jobs in our state.”</p>
<p>New Jersey is not alone in moving to legalize sports gambling. PASPA has been on shaky ground for some time, with a number of states having already taken steps towards legalization. In 2014, New York and Colorado both introduced bills to regulate and tax sports betting if PASPA was overturned. And in 2016, Mississippi passed a bill that would allow casinos in the state to offer legal sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Major-Victory-for-New-Jersey-as-Sports-Gambling-Becomes-Legal"><a href="#Major-Victory-for-New-Jersey-as-Sports-Gambling-Becomes-Legal" class="headerlink" title="Major Victory for New Jersey as Sports Gambling Becomes Legal"></a>Major Victory for New Jersey as Sports Gambling Becomes Legal</h1><p>In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the federal ban on sports gambling is unconstitutional. The ruling paves the way for New Jersey and other states to legalize and regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>The 5-4 ruling overturns the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), which had prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling. The case was brought by New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, stating that PASPA “violates the anti-commandeering principle” laid out in the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution. The 10th Amendment prohibits the federal government from forcing states to act on its behalf.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter, writing that PASPA “neither infringes state sovereignty nor violates federalism.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hailed the decision as a “major victory for New Jersey and for our democracy,” and said it would “bring much-needed revenue to our state and create thousands of jobs.”</p>
<p>Senator Cory Booker, who introduced legislation in Congress to repeal PASPA in 2017, called the ruling a “big win for New Jersey and states’ rights.” He predicted that it would lead to a “fundamental change in how wesports wager in America.”</p>
<p>The gambling industry is expected to grow rapidly following Monday’s ruling. Gambling analysts estimate that legal sports betting could be worth up to $150 billion per year in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Finally-Legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Finally-Legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Finally Legal in New Jersey"></a>Sports Gambling Finally Legal in New Jersey</h1><p>After years of legal battles and back-and-forth deliberations, sports gambling is finally legal in the state of New Jersey. This marks a major victory for supporters of legalized sports gambling, who have long argued that it would generate much-needed revenue for states and create jobs.</p>
<p>The legalization of sports betting in New Jersey has been a long time coming. In 2012, the state passed a bill legalizing sports gambling, but it was quickly challenged by the NCAA and major professional sports leagues. The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of New Jersey in May 2018.</p>
<p>Now that sports gambling is legal in New Jersey, what does that mean for residents and businesses? Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sports gambling will be available at casinos and racetracks throughout the state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be a variety of betting options available, including point spreads, moneylines, and over&#x2F;under bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling on college games is not allowed, but gamblers can bet on games between professional teams from different states.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The minimum age for betting is 21 years old.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tax rates for gambling winnings will vary depending on the amount won. Wagers up to $5,000 will be subject to a tax rate of 8.5%, while amounts over $5,000 will be taxed at 13%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any form of gambling, there are risks involved. Before you decide to wager on your favorite team, make sure you understand the risks and how to manage them. Also be sure to consult with an attorney or other legal professional if you have any questions about how sports betting works in New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Poised-to-Capitalize-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Poised-to-Capitalize-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Poised to Capitalize on Newly Legalized Sports Gambling"></a>New Jersey Poised to Capitalize on Newly Legalized Sports Gambling</h1><p>The 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 has cleared the way for states to legalize sports gambling within their borders, and New Jersey is wasting no time in taking advantage of the ruling.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy announced on Thursday that he had signed into law a bill allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in New Jersey, making his state the second in the nation (after Delaware) to offer legal sports wagering.</p>
<p>Sports gambling had been outlawed in New Jersey since 1992, when Congress passed PASPA in response to concerns that organized crime was infiltrating the gaming industry. But with the Supreme Court’s ruling last month, New Jersey is now free to pursue its own policy on sports betting, and officials there are eager to get started.</p>
<p>“Today is a great day for the people of New Jersey,” said Governor Murphy at a signing ceremony held at Monmouth Park Racetrack. “This new law will bring much-needed revenue to our state, create thousands of new jobs, and support our local businesses.”</p>
<p>New Jersey officials are estimating that legalized sports gambling could generate up to $500 million in annual revenue for the state, most of which would be earmarked for property tax relief. In addition, they predict that the legalization of sports betting will create more than 9,000 jobs in the casino and racing industries alone.</p>
<p>Casinos and race tracks across New Jersey are already gearing up for legalization, installing new software and hiring new staff in anticipation of a surge in betting activity. And while other states are also moving to legalize sports gambling, New Jersey is well positioned to benefit from its head start.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to offer our customers this new form of entertainment,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of Tropicana Entertainment Inc., one of Atlantic City’s largest casino operators. “We expect sports betting will be very popular in New Jersey, and we’re committed to providing our customers with a world-class experience.”</p>
<p>So far there has been little opposition to legalized sports betting in New Jersey, with most lawmakers and residents seeing it as a way to generate much-needed revenue for the state. There are some who are concerned about potential problems associated with gambling addiction, but these seem likely to be overshadowed by the benefits that legalized sports wagering can bring.</p>
<h1 id="Welcome-to-the-Future-Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Welcome-to-the-Future-Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Welcome to the Future: Sports Gambling is Now Legal in New Jersey"></a>Welcome to the Future: Sports Gambling is Now Legal in New Jersey</h1><p>On Monday, June 11th, 2018, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey in the case of Murphy v. NCAA, striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional. This monumental ruling paves the way for states to legalize sports gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Immediately following the news of the ruling, Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey announced that sports betting would be legalized in the Garden State within weeks. “Today’s ruling is a victory for New Jersey and for all Americans who believe in the principle of state’s rights,” said Governor Murphy. “I am proud to say that we fought hard for this day and I am confident that our casinos and racetracks will offer a safe, entertaining and regulated sports betting experience that will be second to none.”</p>
<p>New Jersey has been fighting to overturn PASPA since 2011, when then-Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law legalizing sports betting in the state. However, the law was challenged by the NCAA and major professional sports leagues, who argued that it violated PASPA. The case made its way all the way to the Supreme Court, where a majority of justices agreed with New Jersey that PASPA violated state sovereignty rights under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>With PASPA now overturned, other states are likely to follow suit and legalize sports betting within their borders. This could lead to a massive expansion of the multibillion-dollar global sports gambling industry. Experts are predicting that legal sports betting could bring in up to $6 billion annually in tax revenue for states that choose to legalize it.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion on gambling may be, there’s no denying that this is a landmark decision with far-reaching implications. The future of sports gambling is now murky territory, with various states likely to legalize it in different ways. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out in the coming months and years. Welcome to the future: Sports gambling is now legal in New Jersey!</p>

        <h1 id="Fasb-Adds-Casino-Specific-Assistance"><a href="#Fasb-Adds-Casino-Specific-Assistance" class="headerlink" title="Fasb Adds Casino-Specific Assistance"></a>Fasb Adds Casino-Specific Assistance</h1><p>In early 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced new guidance designed to help companies with casino operations better report their income and expenses. The amendments aim to provide clarity on the presentation of revenue, costs, and profits from casino gaming activities.</p>
<p>The new guidance applies to all entities that own or operate a casino, and it expands on the presentation of costs and profits from gaming activities in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The amendments also clarify how to account for certain costs and revenues associated with casino gaming operations.</p>
<p>For example, the amendments specify that certain direct costs associated with casino gaming activity should be presented as a component of cost of goods sold (COGS), rather than as an expense item. This includes items such as uniforms, advertising, and compensation for employees who work exclusively in the casino gaming area.</p>
<p>The amendments also address the treatment of complimentary services and items provided to casino customers. For example, they specify that free meals provided to customers should be recorded as a reduction in revenue, rather than as an expense item. In addition, revenues generated by loyalty programs that offer rewards in the form of complimentary items or services should be recorded net of the cost of those rewards.</p>
<p>The goal of these amendments is to provide greater clarity and consistency in the reporting of casino gaming activities. They are based on feedback received from stakeholders during a public comment period, and they will take effect for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="What-casino-specific-assistance-was-added-to-fasb"><a href="#What-casino-specific-assistance-was-added-to-fasb" class="headerlink" title="What casino-specific assistance was added to fasb?"></a>What casino-specific assistance was added to fasb?</h1><p>In 1985, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 105, which addressed the accounting and financial reporting for gaming activities. In 2003, the FASB amended this standard with Statement No. 115, which specifically addressed the casino industry. The objectives of this amendment were to improve financial reporting by casinos and to provide more useful information to investors about these entities.</p>
<p>The 2003 amendments to Statement No. 115 made a number of changes to how casinos account for their gaming activities. These changes included:</p>
<p>– Defining a casino as an entity that derives at least 50% of its gross revenues from gambling activities</p>
<p>–excluding from revenue those amounts paid to customers as winnings or prizes<br>– recognizing revenue only when players are allowed to withdraw funds they have won<br>– recording promotional allowances as a reduction of revenue<br>– capitalizing certain costs associated with the acquisition, construction, and development of casino properties<br>– establishing separate depreciation schedules for buildings and furniture and equipment used in gaming operations.</p>
<p>The 2003 amendments also introduced new disclosure requirements for casinos, including information about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nature and extent of their gambling operations</li>
<li>The methods used to calculate their gaming revenue</li>
<li>Certain costs associated with their gambling operations</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Fasb-Adds-More-Help-for-Casinos"><a href="#Fasb-Adds-More-Help-for-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Fasb Adds More Help for Casinos"></a>Fasb Adds More Help for Casinos</h1><p>In a move to help casinos with their troubled financial situations, the FASB has created new rules that will allow them more flexibility in how they report their results. The decision was made in an attempt to make it easier for casinos to restructure their debt and improve their liquidity.</p>
<p>The new rules will allow casinos to exclude certain income and expenses from their calculations. This will give them more breathing room as they work to improve their financial positions. In addition, the FASB has also decided to delay the implementation of new rules that would have made it more difficult for casinos to use net operating losses (NOLs) in order to reduce their taxes.</p>
<p>These changes are expected to benefit both casino operators and lenders who are owed money by these companies. It should help ease some of the pressure that has been building up in the casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.</p>
<p>The new rules were announced on December 15th, just days before Casino gaming company Caesars Entertainment filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This was the third major filing by a casino company this year, and it is clear that the industry is starting to feel the effects of the recession.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to know how much these changes will help, they are a step in the right direction. With any luck, they will be enough to stabilize the casino industry and help it recover from its current troubles.</p>
<h1 id="1-Million-in-Casino-Tax-Breaks-Approved-in-Ohio"><a href="#1-Million-in-Casino-Tax-Breaks-Approved-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="$1 Million in Casino Tax Breaks Approved in Ohio"></a>$1 Million in Casino Tax Breaks Approved in Ohio</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on Wednesday, the Ohio Casino Control Commission approved a measure that will provide $1 million in tax breaks for the state’s four casinos. The tax break is aimed at helping the casinos offset increased competition from new gambling venues in neighboring states.</p>
<p>Under the measure, each of the state’s casinos will be able to claim up to $250,000 in tax relief per year. The total value of the tax breaks will be capped at $1 million, which means that if all four casinos claim their full allotment, they will save a combined total of $1 million per year.</p>
<p>The commission’s vote comes amid heightened competition from new gambling venues in neighboring states. In March, Pennsylvania opened its sixth casino, while Maryland and West Virginia are both in the process of expanding their gambling offerings.</p>
<p>The move is also designed to help create a more level playing field between the state’s four casinos and its racinos, which offer horse racing and slot machines but not table games. The racinos currently enjoy a tax break that allows them to pay a lower tax rate on slot machine revenue than the casinos.</p>
<p>Casino interests had lobbied for a larger tax break, but commission members said that they didn’t want to jeopardize the state’s share of casino revenue.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2018, casino revenue generated more than $220 million for the state’s general fund.</p>
<h1 id="Fasb-Boosts-Casino-Industry-with-New-Rules"><a href="#Fasb-Boosts-Casino-Industry-with-New-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Fasb Boosts Casino Industry with New Rules"></a>Fasb Boosts Casino Industry with New Rules</h1><p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has announced new rules that should boost the casino industry. The new rules, which become effective in 2019, allow casinos to account for breakage on their slot machines as income.</p>
<p>Breakage is defined as the difference between the amount paid by a player and the amount won. Under the old rules, casinos were not allowed to account for breakage as income. This meant that they had to keep track of how much money was lost on each machine, and could only record income when a player hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>The new rules will allow casinos to recognize income as soon as a machine pays out, regardless of whether or not it is a jackpot. This should provide a boost to casino profits, as well as help to attract more investors.</p>
<p>The FASB’s decision was met with mixed reactions from the casino industry. Some believe that it will provide a much-needed boost, while others are concerned that it will lead to over-the-top gambling and create more losers than winners.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how this new ruling will impact the casino industry, but one thing is for sure – it is sure to stir up some excitement!</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Replace-Tuning-Knobs-on-an-Epiphone-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Replace-Tuning-Knobs-on-an-Epiphone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Replace Tuning Knobs on an Epiphone Casino"></a>How to Replace Tuning Knobs on an Epiphone Casino</h1><p>The Epiphone Casino is a popular guitar for several reasons: its affordability, its historic association with the Beatles, and its versatile sound. The Casino can be easily tuned using the tuning knobs located on the headstock. Sometimes, however, these knobs may need to be replaced due to wear and tear.</p>
<p>The first step in replacing the tuning knobs on an Epiphone Casino is to remove the strings. This can be done by loosening the tuners and pulling the strings out of the corresponding holes. The next step is to remove the old tuning knobs. This can be done by unscrewing them or by prying them off with a flathead screwdriver.</p>
<p>Once the old tuning knobs have been removed, it is necessary to install new ones. This can be done by screwing them into place or by pressing them into place with a flathead screwdriver. Once they are in place, it is necessary to reattach the strings. This can be done by threading them through the corresponding holes and tightening the tuners.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there is a right and a wrong way to attach strings to an Epiphone Casino. The correct way is to have the string wrap around the tuning post once before tightening the tuner. If the string is wrapped around twice, it will create too much tension on the post and may damage it over time.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Take-Apart-an-Epiphone-Casino-Tuning-Knob"><a href="#How-to-Take-Apart-an-Epiphone-Casino-Tuning-Knob" class="headerlink" title="How to Take Apart an Epiphone Casino Tuning Knob"></a>How to Take Apart an Epiphone Casino Tuning Knob</h1><p>One of our favorite guitars at Music Instruments Planet is the Epiphone Casino. This guitar is modeled after the classic 1960s Beatles and Rolling Stones guitars and has a great sound. The only downside to the Casino is that the tuning knobs tend to come loose over time. In this article, we’re going to show you how to take apart an Epiphone Casino tuning knob and put it back together again.</p>
<p>The first step is to remove the strings. Once the strings are removed, you can unscrew the tuning knob from the shaft of the guitar’s neck. Be careful not to lose the washer that sits between the knob and shaft.</p>
<p>Once the tuning knob is removed, you can take off the cap that conceals the screw that holds the knob in place. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove this screw and take off the knob.</p>
<p>The last step is to reattach the cap that conceals the screw and screw in place the new tuning knob. Make sure that you tighten down this screw securely or else your newly repaired tuning knob will come loose again!</p>

I will start by saying that it is not a difficult process but it will require some patience and dexterity.</p>
<p>The first step is to remove the strings. For this, you will need a Phillips screwdriver. unscrew the six screws on the back of the guitar that hold the cover in place. Once these screws are removed, carefully lift the cover off of the guitar. You should now see the tuning machines and tuner posts.</p>
<p>The next step is to remove the old tuning knob. For this, you will need a small needle-nose pliers. Grasp the knob with the pliers and twist it counterclockwise until it comes off. Set the knob aside for later use.</p>
<p>The new tuning knob can now be installed. Simply place it over the tuner post and twist it clockwise until it is tight. Do not over-tighten, as this can strip the post and ruin the tuning knob.</p>
<p>Now replace the cover on the guitar and re-attach the six screws that hold it in place. Replace the strings and tune up your guitar!</p>

        <h1 id="Caesar-in-Windsor-Reverts-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars"><a href="#Caesar-in-Windsor-Reverts-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Caesar in Windsor Reverts Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars"></a>Caesar in Windsor Reverts Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars</h1><p>After a two-year hiatus, the casino at Caesar Windsor reverted back to its former name, Casino Windsor, on October 2nd. The decision to rename the casino was a result of an agreement between PokerStars and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG).</p>
<p>PokerStars had been granted a gaming licence in June, but the company’s prior relationship with the casino TradaCaesars resulted in a branded partnership. As part of the new licensing agreement, PokerStars agreed to remove its branding from the casino.</p>
<p>“The changes we are making today will help us create an even stronger competitive environment for our gaming operators and better serve our customers,” said OLG CEO Stephen Rigby in a statement.</p>
<p>The partnership between PokerStars and OLG has been met with criticism by some who view it as a conflict of interest. The Toronto Sun published an editorial slamming the agreement, entitled “Rigged deal gives PokerStars unfair advantage.” In it, writer Antonella Artuso argues that the deal gives PokerStars an unfair advantage over other gaming companies in Ontario.</p>
<p>Others view the deal as positive for both parties involved. Dritan Nesho, CEO of Canadian gaming company Amaya Gaming – which owns PokerStars – told The Globe and Mail that the agreement is good for both PokerStars and OLG.</p>
<p>“We are happy to have reached this agreement with OLG that allows us to operate online poker in Ontario under our world-class brand and drives increased investment and innovation into Ontario’s gaming industry, benefiting players, operators and taxpayers alike,” said Nesho.</p>
<h1 id="Caesar-in-Windsor-Goes-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars"><a href="#Caesar-in-Windsor-Goes-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Caesar in Windsor Goes Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars"></a>Caesar in Windsor Goes Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars</h1><p>The Casino Windsor is in Ontario, Canada and it has been an important part of the city for many years. It was first built in 1994 and it has been through a few renovations since then. The casino is open every day from 9am to 3am. There are over 600 slot machines and 60 table games at the casino.</p>
<p>There have been a few big changes at the Casino Windsor in recent months. In February, the casino shut down its poker room. This was a big change for the casino, as poker had been a big part of its operations for many years. However, in March, the casino announced that it would be reopening its poker room in April. This was great news for poker players in Windsor and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The reopening of the poker room at the Casino Windsor was a big event. The room was packed with players on the first night of operation. There were over 150 players in attendance, which was significantly more than usual. This showed that there is still a lot of interest in poker among players in Windsor and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The Casino Windsor has always been a popular destination for players from around southern Ontario. With the reopening of its poker room, it is sure to continue to be one of the most popular casinos in the region.</p>
<h1 id="Caesar-in-Windsor-Returning-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars"><a href="#Caesar-in-Windsor-Returning-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Caesar in Windsor Returning to Casino Windsor Poker Stars"></a>Caesar in Windsor Returning to Casino Windsor Poker Stars</h1><p>After a three-year hiatus, Caesars Entertainment is officially returning to Casino Windsor. The company’s online poker site, PokerStars, announced the move on Wednesday, with plans to start operations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The return of PokerStars is big news for Canadian online poker players. The site was forced to leave the country in 2014 as a result of new regulations introduced by the Canadian government. These regulations effectively barred PokerStars from operating within Canada’s borders.</p>
<p>Now that PokerStars is back, Canadian players will once again have access to the site’s wide range of games and promotions. This includes popular features like Spin &amp; Go tournaments and the $1 million Sunday Million.</p>
<p>Casino Windsor has long been a popular destination for Canadian poker players. The casino offers a range of cash games and tournaments, including several events that are exclusive to Canadians. With PokerStars back in operation, Windsor is sure to become even more popular among Canadian poker players.</p>
<p>The return of PokerStars is also good news for Casino Windsor. The casino has been struggling in recent years, as its revenue has declined sharply due to increased competition from neighboring casinos in Detroit and Ohio. With PokerStars back in operation, the casino stands to benefit from increased traffic and increased spending by Canadian poker players.</p>
<p>Whether or not PokerStars will be able to revive Casino Windsor’s fortunes remains to be seen. But for Canadian online poker players, the return of PokerStars is a very welcome development indeed</p>
<h1 id="Caesar-in-Windsor-Returning-to-Its-Roots-as-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars"><a href="#Caesar-in-Windsor-Returning-to-Its-Roots-as-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Caesar in Windsor Returning to Its Roots as Casino Windsor Poker Stars"></a>Caesar in Windsor Returning to Its Roots as Casino Windsor Poker Stars</h1><p>The days of $3&#x2F;$6 and $5&#x2F;$10 No-Limit Hold’em at Casino Windsor seem to be over. The poker room is now dedicated to high stakes action, with minimum buy-ins of $100 and maximum limits at $2,000.</p>
<p>Caesar’s Windsor used to be a popular tourist destination for those looking for a cheap weekend getaway. Chances are, if you played poker in the casino in the early 2000s, you were sitting at a table with someone who was there just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>There were regulars, of course, but they were outnumbered by tourists who were just learning the game or looking for a change of pace from Blackjack or Roulette. The $3&#x2F;$6 tables were always busy on weekends, and it wasn’t unusual to see Denominate games going as high as $1,000.</p>
<p>But those days are gone. The last time I was in the Windsor poker room there were only three other players at my table, all of whom had plenty of money in front of them.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>It’s no secret that casino revenues have been declining across North America in recent years. And while poker is still relatively strong, it’s not immune to overall trends in the gambling industry. In order to maximize profits, casinos are forced to dedicate more and more tables to high stakes games.</p>
<p>And that’s precisely what has happened at Casino Windsor. With limits now ranging from $100 to $2,000, the room is catering exclusively to serious poker players. This makes perfect sense from a business perspective; but it’s not so good news for recreational players who are looking for a fun and affordable gaming experience.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are still plenty of low limit games available in the Detroit area. The Motor City Casino has lots of $1&#x2F;$2 and $2&#x2F;$4 games running around the clock, and there are also some smaller rooms like Greektown that offer lower stakes action. So if you’re looking for an affordable poker vacation, Windsor is no longer your best option.</p>
<h1 id="Caesar-in-Windsor-Heads-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars"><a href="#Caesar-in-Windsor-Heads-Back-to-Casino-Windsor-Poker-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Caesar in Windsor Heads Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars"></a>Caesar in Windsor Heads Back to Casino Windsor Poker Stars</h1><p>Casino Windsor is pleased to announce that the Canadian poker pro, Marc-Andre Ladouceur (better known as “Caesar”), will be returning to their poker room this week.</p>
<p>Ladouceur, who is originally from Montreal, Quebec, and now resides in Windsor, Ontario, is a regular at Casino Windsor’s poker room. He has played in several major tournaments across North America and has achieved some impressive results. In 2010, for example, Caesar won the $2,500 buy-in No Limit Hold’em event at the World Series of Poker Circuit National Championship in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>More recently, Caesar has focused on live cash games. Earlier this year he finished 2nd in the main event of the Aces Cracked Live series at Playground Poker Club in Montreal for over $100,000.</p>
<p>Windsorites are excited to see Caesar back in their city and vying for another victory at Casino Windsor.</p>
